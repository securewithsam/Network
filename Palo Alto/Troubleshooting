show system state filter chassis.leds ( to check leds)
show system environmentals (to check fan and psu)

show interface ethernet1/1 | match link ( To check interface)
show log system query equal "( eventid eq link-change ) and ( object eq 'ethernet1/1' )" direction equal backward     (To check interface flapping /up and down)


APP-ID | Vulnerability Profile | Antivirus Profile are L7 and perform DPI (deep packet inspection) and will use full resources.

How to check sessions or throughput : Match againts the datasheet for the model#
#show session info

#show counter global filter severity warn delta yes
#show running resource-monitor second ( to review dataplane CPU usage)

#show running resource-monitor ingress-backlogs



To check if a policy is working or not :

PA>test security-policy-match source 10.1.1.1 destination 200.1.1.1 protocol 1
PA>test routing fib-lookup virtual-router default ip 200.1.1.1

PA>Debug Dataplane packet-diag set filter match source 10.1.1.1 destination 200.1.1.1 
PA>Debug Dataplane packet-diag set filter on
PA>show counter global filter packet-filter yes severity drop

(then test the policy or tyr to ping and chk the debug for more info)
